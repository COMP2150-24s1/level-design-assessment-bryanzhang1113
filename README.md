# COMP2150  - Level Design Document
### Name: Bryan Zhang
### Student number: 47393068 

This document discusses and reflects on the design of your platformer level for the Level Design assessment. It should be 1500 words. Make sure you delete this and all other instructional text throughout the document before checking your word count prior to submission. Hint: You can check word count by copying this text into a Word or Google doc.

Your document must include images. To insert an image into your documentation, place it in the "DocImages" folder in this repo, then place the below text where you want the image to appear:

```

## 1. Player Experience (~700 words)
Outline and justify how your level design facilitates the core player experience goals outlined in the assignment spec. Each section should be supported by specific examples and screenshots of your game encounters that highlight design choices made to facilitate that particular experience.

### 1.1. Discovery
What does the player learn? How does your encounter and broader level design facilitate learning in a way that follows good design practice?
- When the player boots up the game, they are spawned in the first section of the level. This is the easiest level to complete because it is a simple form of parkour, with hazardous acid to jump over as the player progress throughout the section. Near the final part of the section, the pink spikes are introduced to the player. There are a total of 4 checkpoints and 3 health crates for the player should they struggle.

### 1.2. Drama
What is the intensity curve? How does your design facilitate increasing yet modulating intensity, with moments of tension and relief?
- The intensity curve is a graph that depicts the stress level for a videogame. For my level, I have structured my sections so that there is relief when obtaining a health box and maximum stress during the middle of the section. 

### 1.3. Challenge
What are the main challenges? How have you designed and balanced these challenges to control the difficulty curve and keep the player in the flow channel?
- Section 1
In section 1
- Section 2
- Section 3
navigating through platforms while avoiding enemies and obstacles
finding the switch to activate the door
- Keys
I have placed each key in a specific location of each section that requires the player to explore further should they choose to skip its path. I have placed areas where players can choose their own path to go through.  

### 1.4. Exploration
How does your level design facilitate autonomy and invite the player to explore? How do your aesthetic and layout choices create distinct and memorable spaces and/or places?
- The level has different paths to take, allowing decision making available for the player.

## 2. Core Gameplay (~400 words)
A section on Core Gameplay, where storyboards are used to outline how you introduce the player to each of the required gameplay elements in the first section of the game. Storyboards should follow the format provided in lectures.

Storyboards can be combined when multiple mechanics are introduced within a single encounter. Each section should include a sentence or two to briefly justify why you chose to introduce the mechanic/s to the player in that sequence.

You should restructure the headings below to match the order they appear in your level.

### 2.1. Acid
- I used acid pools primarily in section 1 to allow the player to learn and utilise the jumping mechanic. As they get familiar and complete section 1, I have acid pools reoccuring in section 3.

### 2.2. Checkpoints
- Checkpoints are in place for stress relief and saving the player's time to redo specific areas of sections.

### 2.4. Health Pickups
- They are placed in safe areas but some are more difficult to obtain.

### 2.5. Keys
- I have placed them in specific areas where they are easily viewed from another section. This is to allow players to memorise the location of the keys so they know what to look for when they are close to each key.

### 2.11. Weapon Pickup (Staff)
- I have placed this at the beginning of the third section so that players now know they must use this weapon to kill the chompers.

### 2.3. Chompers

### 2.8. Spikes

### 2.6. Moving Platforms

### 2.7. Passthrough Platforms

### 2.9. Spitters

## 3. Spatiotemporal Design
A section on Spatiotemporal Design, which includes your molecule diagram and annotated level maps (one for each main section of your level). These diagrams may be made digitally or by hand, but must not be created from screenshots of your game. The annotated level maps should show the structure you intend to build, included game elements, and the path the player is expected to take through the level. Examples of these diagrams are included in the level design lectures.

No additional words are necessary for this section (any words should only be within your images/diagrams).
 
### 3.1. Molecule Diagram

### 3.2. Level Map – Section 1

### 3.3.	Level Map – Section 2

### 3.4.	Level Map – Section 3

## 4. Iterative Design (~400 words)
Reflect on how iterative design helped to improve your level. Additional prototypes and design artefacts should be included to demonstrate that you followed an iterative design process (e.g. pictures of paper prototypes, early grey-boxed maps, additional storyboards of later gameplay sequences, etc.). You can also use this section to justify design changes made in Unity after you drew your level design maps shown in section 3. 

You should conclude by highlighting a specific example of an encounter, or another aspect of your level design, that could be improved through further iterative design.

## Generative AI Use Acknowledgement

Use the below table to indicate any Generative AI or writing assistance tools used in creating your document. Please be honest and thorough in your reporting, as this will allow us to give you the marks you have earnt. Place any drafts or other evidence inside this repository. This form and related evidence do not count to your word count.
An example has been included. Please replace this with any actual tools, and add more as necessary.


### Tool Used: ChatGPT
**Nature of Use** Finding relevant design theory.

**Evidence Attached?** Screenshot of ChatGPT conversation included in the folder "GenAI" in this repo.

**Additional Notes:** I used ChatGPT to try and find some more relevant design theory that I could apply to my game. After googling them, however, I found most of them were inaccurate, and some didn't exist. One theory mentioned, however, was useful, and I've incorporated it into my work.
